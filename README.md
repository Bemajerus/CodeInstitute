## Target Audience

The target audience for this website is not only Vasco da Gama fans who want to learn more about the club's history but also anyone interested in understanding the history of the fight against racism in early 1900s Brazil, where Vasco was a pioneer. The website contains pages on the history, the struggle against racism, and legendary players of the club. It aims to provide valuable insights and information for a diverse range of visitors interested in these topics.

## User stories

The content will not change too much so the user experience goals for the first time visitor to returning visitor are essentially the same. These goals are primarily:

### As a supporter I would like to know more about the club's history
With sections about the founding of the rowing club and subsequently the football club, fans can learn more about the club's history and its most famous players, along with a photo featuring the view of São Januário, the stadium built by the team's own supporters.

### Learning about the impact of racism in football during the 1900s.
Understanding Vasco da Gama's fight against the racism that affected black and lower-class players who played for the team, which, through the historic letter known as the "Historical Response," directly challenged the organization of the time that sought to exclude these players from the championship.
