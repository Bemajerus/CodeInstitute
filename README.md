## Target Audience

The target audience for this website is not only Vasco da Gama fans who want to learn more about the club's history but also anyone interested in understanding the history of the fight against racism in early 1900s Brazil, where Vasco was a pioneer. The website contains pages on the history, the struggle against racism, and legendary players of the club. It aims to provide valuable insights and information for a diverse range of visitors interested in these topics.

## User stories

The content will not change too much so the user experience goals for the first time visitor to returning visitor are essentially the same. These goals are primarily:

### As a supporter I would like to know more about the club's history
With sections about the founding of the rowing club and subsequently the football club, fans can learn more about the club's history and its most famous players, along with a photo featuring the view of São Januário, the stadium built by the team's own supporters.

### Learning about the impact of racism in football during the 1900s.
Understanding Vasco da Gama's fight against the racism that affected black and lower-class players who played for the team, which, through the historic letter known as the "Historical Response," directly challenged the organization of the time that sought to exclude these players from the championship.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

.....foto do esquema de cores

The choice of colors in the team's shirt and badge is reflected in the website design. The black and white colors symbolize the club's openness to people of all races and social backgrounds, without discrimination. The red color represents the symbol that the navigator Vasco da Gama applied to his ships and banners, the Cross of the Order of Christ.

### Typography

For the primary font, the Long Shot font was chosen, which is the same font used by the Vasco da Gama institution in its marketing and social media activities.

....foto long shot

The Roboto Condensed font was selected as the secondary font because it complements the primary font nicely.

### Imagery

The chosen images portray Vasco's history, including its jersey, stadium, the letter against racism, and the team nicknamed the "Camisas Negras" (Black Shirts) from the 1900s.

### Wireframes

I used Figma to design my wireframes

## Features


### General features on each page

### Navbar

I used HTML and CSS for the navbar, below are two views of the desktop view and the responsive mobile view that transforms into a hamburger menu.

...mobile navbar

### Footer with social media buttons

I added the Vasco da Gama badge in the middle of the footer, and on the right side I added three social media icons form facebook, instagram and youtube. The media icons were sourced from iconfinder and I kept them in their original colors to give them a bit more prominence in the footer.

## Features by page

### History page

The history page starts with an image of the game jersey focused on the Cross of the Order of Christ, followed by a text recounting the history of Vasco da Gama's founding, and lastly, a photo of São Januário, the stadium built by the team's own supporters.

....history page

### Fight against racism page

The page about the fight against racism begins with an iconic photo of the team known as the "Camisas Negras" (Black Shirts), a famous Vasco team that battled against racism in football in the early 1900s. After the image, there's a text providing more details about this fight. Finally, the page concludes with the image and transcription of the famous letter known as the "Historical Response", which was sent to the organizers who wanted Vasco to exclude black players from its team.

### Legends page

The Legends page features some of Vasco da Gama's greatest idols and plays with the grid layout, varying the position of the photo and the text to enhance the page's visual appeal. The page includes photos of memorable players and a brief description of Vasco da Gama's idols for a more engaging user experience.

### Accessibility

It was requested that the shade of red be slightly lighter to improve visibility on the black background.
