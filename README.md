## Target Audience

The target audience for this website is not only Vasco da Gama fans who want to learn more about the club's history but also anyone interested in understanding the history of the fight against racism in early 1900s Brazil, where Vasco was a pioneer. The website contains pages on the history, the struggle against racism, and legendary players of the club. It aims to provide valuable insights and information for a diverse range of visitors interested in these topics.

## User stories

The content will not change too much so the user experience goals for the first time visitor to returning visitor are essentially the same. These goals are primarily:

### As a supporter I would like to know more about the club's history
With sections about the founding of the rowing club and subsequently the football club, fans can learn more about the club's history and its most famous players, along with a photo featuring the view of São Januário, the stadium built by the team's own supporters.

### Learning about the impact of racism in football during the 1900s.
Understanding Vasco da Gama's fight against the racism that affected black and lower-class players who played for the team, which, through the historic letter known as the "Historical Response," directly challenged the organization of the time that sought to exclude these players from the championship.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

.....foto do esquema de cores

The choice of colors in the team's shirt and badge is reflected in the website design. The black and white colors symbolize the club's openness to people of all races and social backgrounds, without discrimination. The red color represents the symbol that the navigator Vasco da Gama applied to his ships and banners, the Cross of the Order of Christ.

### Typography

For the primary font, the Long Shot font was chosen, which is the same font used by the Vasco da Gama institution in its marketing and social media activities.

....foto long shot

The Roboto Condensed font was selected as the secondary font because it complements the primary font nicely.

The chosen images portray Vasco's history, including its jersey, stadium, the letter against racism, and the team nicknamed the "Camisas Negras" (Black Shirts) from the 1900s.

### Footer with social media buttons

I added the Vasco da Gama badge in the middle of the footer, and on the right side I added three social media icons form facebook, instagram and youtube. The media icons were sourced from iconfinder and I kept them in their original colors to give them a bit more prominence in the footer.
