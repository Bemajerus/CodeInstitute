                <h3>ROBERTO DINAMITE</h3>
                
                <p>Roberto Dinamite, the top scorer in Vasco's history and the Brazilian Championship, embodies the club. His importance to Vasco is beyond words.</p>
                <p>Throughout his career, he won significant titles, including a Brazilian Championship in 1974 and several Carioca Championships (1977, 1982, 1987, 1988, and 1992). He scored over 700 goals for the Cruz-maltino team. Dinamite's legend as a player transcends football and has become a symbol of love and dedication to Vasco, being a figure that will always be revered in the club's history.</p>

            <div class="text-grid-position-desktop">
                <h3>ROMARIO</h3>
                
                <p>Brought up through Vasco's youth ranks, the hero of Brazil's 1994 World Cup title also amassed numerous trophies with the Cruz-maltino, including the 2000 Mercosul Cup, the 2000 Brazilian Championship, and the Carioca Championships of 1987 and 1988.</p>
                <p>His journey at the club was also marked by various controversies, including ego clashes with other players, such as Edmundo, and multiple transfers in and out of the team. Although his brilliance and on-field accomplishments place him among Vasco's greatest talents and idols, his controversial nature and the lack of profound declarations of love for the club have kept him from being labeled as Vasco's greatest idol in history. Nonetheless, "Baixinho" is remembered as an iconic figure in Vasco's history.</p>

                <h3>JUNINHO PERNAMBUCANO</h3>
                
                <p>The "Reizinho" is a symbol of love for Vasco. His time at the club was marked by a series of important titles, including two Brazilian Championships (1997 and 2000), a Carioca Championship (1998), the Copa Libertadores (1998), the Rio-São Paulo Tournament (1999), and the Mercosul Cup (2000).</p>
                <p>However, his everlasting image is that of the stunning free-kick goal scored against River Plate in the 1998 Libertadores semi-finals, a moment etched in the memory of Vasco's fans and which inspired a chant still sung in stadiums today. Juninho is remembered not only for his achievements but also for his devotion to Vasco and his unparalleled skill in set pieces.</p>

                <h3>EDMUNDO</h3>
                
                <p>Edmundo was the best player of the 1997 Brazilian Championship. His fiery personality, which sometimes hindered him, earned him the nickname "Animal," but it was offset by his consistent goal-scoring ability.</p>
                <p>During his multiple stints at São Januário, he contributed to winning significant titles, including the Carioca Championship in 1992. Despite personal controversies, he is remembered as a talented player with a passion for Vasco, whose impact on the club transcended his controversies.</p>

                <h3>BARBOSA</h3>
                
                <p>Barbosa, a giant at Vasco, is remembered not only for his achievements but also for his intricate history. His career with the club was marked by numerous Carioca Championship titles (1945, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1952, and 1958), as well as the South American Championship of Champions in 1948 and the Rio-São Paulo Tournament in 1958.</p>
                <p>However, he also faced exaggerated and even racist criticism following the goal conceded against Uruguay in the fateful 1950 World Cup final, which cost Brazil the title. Despite this, Barbosa was never wronged by Vasco. He remains a revered figure in the hearts of fans, remembered not just for his skills as a goalkeeper, but also for his greatness as a person.</p>
