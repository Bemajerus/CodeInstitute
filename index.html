        <p>Vasco was founded as a rowing club in 1898 by a group of 63 young men, Portuguese immigrants and their descendants, gathered in the Saúde neighborhood. The chosen name was Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama, as that year marked the 400th anniversary of the famed admiral's voyage to India. Affiliated with the União de Regatas, Vasco's debut in official competitions took place on June 4, 1899, in the Botafogo bay. There, the rowboat "Volúvel," with six oars, won the first race in the junior category, marking Vasco's first victory in rowing.</p>

        <p>In November 1915, the Lusitânia football club was incorporated into Vasco, giving rise to the Vasco da Gama football department, despite opposition from Vasco rowers. Vasco made its debut on May 3, 1916, in the third division, losing 10-1 against Paladino Foot-Ball Club.</p>
            
        <p>Though it was founded as a "rowing club," becoming one of the continent's most celebrated champions in rowing, Vasco da Gama also encompasses other sports like athletics, beach volleyball, basketball, beach soccer, among others, with soccer being its most traditional sport. Vasco's colors hold profound meaning: the black alludes to the unknown seas of the East, explored by Vasco da Gama, while the white diagonal stripe refers to the route discovered by the admiral.</p>
            
        <p>Furthermore, these colors fit the idea of a communion of ethnicities (since it was Brazil's first club to fight against racial and social prejudices), having been the first in the history of Brazilian sports clubs to elect a "non-white" president. The Cross, its primary symbol, has a strong religious significance, as the Military Order of Christ was both religious and warrior-like. The nickname "Gigante da Colina" (Giant of the Hill) comes from the Historical Hill, which started on an incline from the current stadium's actual grounds, which was terraced and rose towards today's Barreira do Vasco, closing in an arch with the Pedregulho Hill, where the current Ricardo Machado street passes.</p>
