        <p>Throughout its 120-year history, Vasco da Gama has been a South American champion, Libertadores champion, Brazilian Cup winner, won the Brasileirão four times, and the Carioca championship multiple times. However, no on-field achievement holds the same weight as a letter, so emblematic, that it is displayed in the trophy room at São Januário. On April 7, 1924, then-president José Augusto Prestes signed the manifesto known as the "Historical Response," announcing that Vasco would refuse to compete in the primary division of Rio de Janeiro without its black players, a requirement that had been imposed by the directors of the time. The symbolic significance of this act, deemed rebellious during a time when elite football was a privilege of the white population, transformed the Vasco team into a beacon in the fight against racism in Brazilian sports.</p>
        <p>The champion team of the second division in 1922 boasted talents who were manual laborers, chauffeurs, painters, and janitors. Thus, they secured the right to compete in the first division the following year alongside the already established América, Botafogo, Flamengo, and Fluminense.</p>
        <p>Maintaining a core group of manual workers on the team, Vasco outperformed the favorites, clinched 11 victories in 14 matches, and won the championship organized by the Metropolitan League of Terrestrial Sports (LMDT). Disturbed by Vasco's rapid rise, rivals decided to create a new league, the Metropolitan Association of Athletic Sports (AMEA), imposing on the club, nicknamed "Black Shirts" because of its uniform color, the requirement to exclude 12 players who, according to the league officials, did not have the "social conditions appropriate for sporting interaction." Illiteracy was one of the reasons listed by the league to disqualify part of the champion roster.</p>
        <p>Unanimously, the Vasco board declined to join the AMEA and then sent a letter to the league explaining why they rejected the order to exclude black and poor players. "The public act that might tarnish them will never be committed with the solidarity of those who lead the house that welcomed them, nor under the flag they so valiantly covered with glory," states the fifth paragraph of the Historical Response.</p>
        <p>Vasco was also the first Brazilian sports club to have a black president, Cândido José de Araújo, who held the position from 1904 to 1906.</p>

        <p>"Rio de Janeiro, April 7, 1924.<br>
            Official No. 261<br>
            To: Dr. Arnaldo Guinle,<br>
            President of the Metropolitan Association of Athletic Sports.</p>

        <p>The resolutions announced today by the press, taken in yesterday's meeting by the highest authorities of the Association that Your Excellency so honorably presides over, place Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama in such a position of inferiority that it absolutely cannot be justified, neither by the deficiencies of our field nor by the simplicity of our headquarters, nor by the modest condition of a large number of our members.</p>
        <p>The privileges granted to the five founding clubs of A.M.E.A., and the manner in which the right to discussion and voting will be exercised, and future classifications made, compel us to lodge our protest against the mentioned resolutions.</p>
        <p>Regarding the condition of eliminating twelve of our players from our teams, the board of C.R. Vasco da Gama unanimously decided not to accept it, as we do not agree with the process by which the investigation of the social positions of these members was conducted, an investigation brought to a tribunal where they had neither representation nor defense.</p>
        <p>We are sure that Your Excellency will be the first to recognize that it would be an act unbefitting of us to sacrifice, out of the desire to be part of A.M.E.A., some of those who fought for us to achieve, among other victories, the Football Championship of the City of Rio de Janeiro in 1923.</p>
        <p>These twelve players, young, almost all Brazilians, at the beginning of their careers, will not be publicly tarnished with the solidarity of those who lead the house that welcomed them, nor under the flag they so valiantly covered with glory.</p>
        <p>In these terms, we regret to inform Your Excellency that we have decided not to be part of A.M.E.A.</p>
        <p>Please, Your Excellency, accept the highest considerations and esteem from the one who has the honor to sign off, Yours Sincerely, Thank you.</p>

        <p>(a) José Augusto Prestes<br>
        President"</p><br>
